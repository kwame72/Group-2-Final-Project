About Our New York Airport Shuttle
Payment, Booking & Cancellation
How may I get a quote?
All trips have set prices; refer to the “Services” page. 
For Special Reservation: To get a quote, call our Customer Care Center at 914-555-5341 or 844-555-7433. Pricing is subject to change without notice at any point between the quote request and the final booking.
2. How do I cancel my reservation?
We understand your travel plans may change, so we offer a very simple cancellation policy. Regardless of whether you made your reservation online, or by calling our customer care center, just give us 4 hours notice prior to your pickup time and a full refund will be provided.
ETS is unable to refund payment if cancelled with less than 4 hours notice prior to pickup time or in the event of a no-show. Credit card refunds are submitted to the financial institution within 1 business day; please check with your financial institution for more information.
